In order to compile the code, use make. This will create an executable called dijkstra which can then be run.
Before compilation, two things must be changed for each test case. The global variable, V, is the number of vertices in the graph and the graph[V][V] is the adjacency matrix. If both are not changed and accurate, the program will not function as intended. 

During testing, the examples in parts a and b worked as intended and the output of my program matched the correct answer. Also, I did run my program on a few examples from the website and those also worked as intended. 

A couple years ago in my discrete math class I coded a program (that was solely for practice and not for another assignment) that executed Dijkstra and given that I am 2 years further into my CS career I wanted to try and make it a bit more complex so I decided to use a priority queue.
